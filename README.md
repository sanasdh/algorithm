## Types of Sorting: Comparison Sort

There are two major types of sorting algorithms. The first we’ll cover is comparison sort. It does what it says on the tin: It compares two items and decides which one to put first.

If you’re comparing numbers, use their values. If you’re comparing words, use the alphabet. If you’re comparing Lego blocks, use their size, like below.

## Types of Sorting: Distribution Sort
Instead of comparing two items, distribution sort uses some property of the item itself to decide where it fits. Most of the time, this means dividing the items into groups based on some characteristic of the data itself. With our Lego blocks, this could mean grouping them by color.

Comparison and distribution sort aren’t better or worse than one another. They simply function differently, which means that they’re better suited for different types of data sets.
