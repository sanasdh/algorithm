* Insertion Sort

Basically, an insertion sort takes each item and inserts it into the right place in the array.
Like bubble sort, insertion sort isn’t terribly efficient — it ends up traversing over and over the array many times. However, it’s definitely faster than bubble sort and works more efficiently in a wider variety of circumstances. It’s mainly used in real life in conjunction with bucket sort.

It's  stable sort. The cards remained sorted, even as we completed more iterations through the set.

Big O worst case space complexity:
O(1), We don't have to find a new space for any of our cards while we were sorting them. That makes the space efficiency 

Big O worst case time complexity:
O(N^2)
